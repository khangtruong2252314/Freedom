### Assignment 1 (91 / 100, 99 / 100), 2 (100 / 100)
Assignment 1: ~ 4 days \
Assignment 2: ~ 1 week \
Nah, nothing to say \
To students who read this message: Too easy 

### Assignment 3 (71 / 100)
Coding the backbone: 3 days \
Debugging: ~2 weeks \
This is the best assignment in the course (and the most difficult cuz you are going to implement everything by yourself :)))))). \
Harmony code is soooo bad, maybe it is the worst code I have ever seen \
Design your code smartly and you will fail... because the harmony code used is sooooo..... well, don't want to say \
To students who read this message: Remember, no matter if you study with Mr.Phung or Mr.Duy, watch the video on Youtube and done. \
You code smart? &#8594; You die of harmony \
Every thing else... gud. \
I have a free code for type 2 programming code, quite difficult to use (need to use the HTML file) and different from what Mr.Duy taught (Mr.Phung won't teach the framework, we do what we want in the programming code). \
But still no match for me :)))) \
Weakness of this project code: 
* Ignore some (super complex array) cases (too lazy to implement) :)))))
* Should not be the Variable_.Exception, it is redundant, do not make similar mistake :((((

### Assignment 4 (85 / 100)
Coding + Debugging: ~ 1 week \
Well-prepared init code \
Emitter.py, Frame.py, MachineCode.py (excellent) \
CodeGenerator.py (The init code left so much trash in there) \
Harmony code is good, but too difficult
#### Notice: 
####    - "javac" is used to create .class files from .java files
####    - Use Intellij IDEA to see java byte code for a real Java program

Weakness of this project code: 
* Haven't implement code generating for some *multi-dimensional array*, case: *int arr[100, 100]; int b = arr[1]* fail
* Trash in code, hehe. For example: LegendaryVisitor, ready for cheating, but I didn't cheat 


Final Assignment score: 7 / 10 \
Oh yeah, I knew that if I had fixed the bugs in those assignments, my score would still be the same :)))) 

Some more:
* Mr.Phung is more likely to talk about core knowledge in the course - of course very important, but he doesn't really care about harmony
* Mr.Duy is more likely to write the harmony exam

### Final thing to say: never put so much effort on assignment, 50% of the testcases is enough, since you will never get away with Harmony.
