# You know what should be here :))))

# Assignment 1 (91 / 100, 99 / 100), 2 (100 / 100)
Nah, nothing to say

# Assignment 3 (71 / 100)
This is the best assignment in the course (and the most difficult). 
Harmony code is soooo bad, maybe it is the worst code I have ever seen

# Assignment 4 (85 / 100)
Emitter.py, Frame.py, MachineCode.py (excellent)
CodeGenerator.py (The init code left so much trash in there)
Harmony code is good, but too difficult

Final Assignment score: 7 / 10
