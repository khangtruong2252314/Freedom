### Assignment 3 (71 / 100)
This is the best assignment in the course (and the most difficult). \
Harmony code is soooo bad, maybe it is the worst code I have ever seen \
Design your code smartly and you will fail... because the harmony code used is sooooo..... well, don't want to say \
This is the teacher who write the harmony code <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkRs4FhdBM&list=PLTpNwHSD94uv-fEGdAHZURE-fvp9pBOTp> \
To students who read this message: Remember, no matter if you study with Mr.Phung or Mr.Duy, watch the video on Youtube and shut up. You code smart? -> You die

### Assignment 4 (85 / 100)
Well-prepared init code \
Emitter.py, Frame.py, MachineCode.py (excellent) \
CodeGenerator.py (The init code left so much trash in there) \
Harmony code is good, but too difficult \
#### Notice: 
####    - "javac" is used to create .class files
####    - Use Intellij IDEA to see java byte code for a real Java program

Final Assignment score: 7 / 10
