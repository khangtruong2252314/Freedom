### Assignment 1 (91 / 100, 99 / 100), 2 (100 / 100)
Nah, nothing to say \
To students who read this message: Too easy 

### Assignment 3 (71 / 100)
This is the best assignment in the course (and the most difficult). \
Harmony code is soooo bad, maybe it is the worst code I have ever seen \
Design your code smartly and you will fail... because the harmony code used is sooooo..... well, don't want to say \
Refer to <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atkRs4FhdBM&list=PLTpNwHSD94uv-fEGdAHZURE-fvp9pBOTp> \
To students who read this message: Remember, no matter if you study with Mr.Phung or Mr.Duy, watch the video on Youtube and done. You code smart? &#8594; You die \
Every thing else... gud. \
Weakness of this project code: Ignore some (super complex array)

### Assignment 4 (85 / 100)
Well-prepared init code \
Emitter.py, Frame.py, MachineCode.py (excellent) \
CodeGenerator.py (The init code left so much trash in there) \
Harmony code is good, but too difficult
#### Notice: 
####    - "javac" is used to create .class files from .java files
####    - Use Intellij IDEA to see java byte code for a real Java program
Weakness of this project code: Haven't implement code generating for some *multi-dimension array*, case: *int arr[100, 100]; int b = arr[1]* fail
